# Multiplicative-Analogue-of-Differences
Euler proved the interpolations of a function around a known point using method of differences and summation operator. Such interpolations are highly useful in the algebraic domain but fail to perfectly mimic the transcendental domains. To tackle this problem, we introduce a multiplicative and tetrational analogue of the euler's difference formulas
