\begin{abstract}
Euler introduced a method for interpolating a function from a uniformly spaced set of known values using his celebrated difference formula:
\[
f(a + x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \binom{x}{k} \Delta^k f(a),
\]
where the operator $\Delta^k f(a)$ denotes the $k$-th forward difference of the function evaluated at the point $a$.

This formula is profoundly effective in discrete algebraic settings, offering a systematic way to interpolate functions from finite, equally spaced data. However, in non-algebraic analytical contexts, the expansion may exhibit irregular behavior near boundaries or at certain singular points. While such anomalies can often be mitigated, a deeper generalization is desirable to extend its utility and establish broader structural properties.

In this work, we propose a **multiplicative analogue** of Eulerâ€™s interpolation method. We develop a novel product expansion suited for factorial-like functions and present a **binomial analogue of the tetration function**, derived from our formulation. This approach not only broadens the algebraic scope of the classical difference method but also opens a new direction for interpolating functions in product-based discrete structures.
